## Requirements

* Java 8 or newer.
* A reasonably sized image (for example ≤ 2048 × 1536) to avoid memory issues.

## Build and Run

From the project root, compile and launch:

```bash
javac Main.java
java Main
```

The program starts with an empty window.
Use **File → Import** to load a photo, then:

* **Double-click** the photo to flip to the back side for annotation.
* **Single-click** on the back to set a text insertion point and type.
* **Drag with the mouse** on the back to draw strokes.
* **File → Delete** removes the current photo and annotations.
